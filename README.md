# Text-Generation-with-Markov-Chains

This project implements a simple text generation algorithm using Markov chains. By analyzing an input corpus, the program builds a statistical model that captures the likelihood of characters or words following one another. Using this model, it generates new, coherent sequences that mimic the style and structure of the original text. This approach demonstrates the fundamentals of probabilistic language modeling and provides a lightweight alternative to more complex neural language models.
